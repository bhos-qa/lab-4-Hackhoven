# Learning Outputs from Coverage Research

## Statement Coverage
- Statement coverage ensures every statement in the code is executed at least once.
- I learned that it is a fundamental metric to ensure basic code testing, but it doesn't guarantee every branch or condition is tested.

## Branch Coverage
- Branch coverage focuses on testing every possible branch (true/false conditions) in the program.
- It helps in identifying logical paths that might be missed during testing.

## Predicate Coverage
- Predicate coverage ensures that every condition within a decision is evaluated both ways (true and false).
- This goes deeper into logical evaluations to make the testing process more comprehensive.
